									<h3 class="minor">Senior Business Analyst Manager – Competition Risk</h3>
										<h4 class="minor"><i>Jul 2021 - Jul 2022 (1 year)</i></h4>
										<p>Performed analysis in multiple dimensions of the level of competition risk (cartel and anti-competitive conduct) across the ANZ Group (focusing on APAC branches) - helping with the pilot ANZ ServiceNow software for non-financial risk framework.  Document business risk processes and financial risk procedures for internal/external audit investigations and help rollout ServiceNow software.</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>Using Confluence & Jira, I implemented competition risk register on ANZ’s pilot ServiceNow to document, mapping our risk approach process and assisted with the pilot non-financial risk.  By creating workflow & project trackers and guidance notes, I prepared our audit documentation procedure for audit purposes (reporting to ACCC and ASIC) and liaising with senior stakeholders (OREC Board reporting).</li>
										</ul>
											<p></p>
										<ul>
											<li>By researching and discovering each business units’ processes (particularly DCM and securitisation,  multi-bank deals,  M&A and JV deals) I could better appreciate the commercial aspect and apply a best-approach for non-financial risk framework rollout across ANZ business units and products across institutional, retail and credit risk divisions.</li>										
										</ul>
											<p></p>
										<ul>
											<li>I was privileged to have been seconded to the Credit Risk team where I further developed my SQL skills where I was given a sample portfolio of small business accounts across various industries and locations. The goal was to improve ANZ’s small business lending by performing automated background credit assessments to unlock further credit lending opportunities to reduce bank approval time to 2 hours.  Using SQL and factor analysis, I performed various scenario analyses and hypothesis testing, noting key limitations and assumptions set in the models – presenting my proposed framework to the team and the leader.  From the portfolio of 15,000 SME’s, my framework proposed approx. $14m based on transaction history and industry predicted market trends. </li>

									<h3 class="minor">Senior Financial Analyst – Finance and Tax Specialist - Suncorp</h3>
										<h4 class="minor"><i>May 2019 - Jun 2021 (2.2 years)</i></h4>
										<p>Prepare periodic returns and legal reports for senior stakeholders and assist with P&L calculations. Compliance tax and financial risk assessment via data analysis and modelling (PowerBI) across wealth and insurance functions.  Monitored changes in stakeholder contracts, tax legislation, insurance and wealth policy and regulations that would affect current internal processes.</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>Conducted in-house investigation and evaluation to analyse transactional data, verifying compliance and investment oversight processes.  I analysed the investment funds and prepare a risk scenario analysis based on qualitative and quantitative factors, liaising with the senior leadership team. As a result, we divested from the Wealth function and I was required to recreate a PIE fund distribution and tax calculation for an external advisory firm to verify before closure.</li>
										</ul>
											<p></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Using a Kaizen approach, I developed background automated processes (using Oracle and VBA) to enhance periodic return processes and expense reviews, fund distributions and cross-border payments.  This reduced team resource requirements, increasing task turnaround by overriding manual procedures, enhancing the accuracy of calculations allowing more attention to higher risk/profile transactions. The outcome was 4.5 day, 3 person team process reduced to half day, 1 person requirement.</li>
										</ul>	
											<p></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Reviewed the credit risk of a specific insurance product (MVI) which was underperforming, calculating the expected capital loss and transfer portion of the risk externally.  Using SQL queries and PowerBI, I was able to identify the suspected channels and products which were loss leading on an individual product basis.  The key reason MVI’s were part of a specific brokers’ loss leading price strategy to capture new customers. As a result, we employed reinsurance contracts reducing the risk on the MVI’s.</li>
										</ul>

									<h3 class="minor">Private Senior Consultant (Wealth and Tax) - BDO (Binder Dijker Otte)</h3>
										<h4 class="minor"><i>Jan 2017 - May 2019 (2.5 years)</i></h4>
										<p>Prepare business and tax consulting advice including due diligence of sale and purchase agreements: researching industry news, local and foreign legislation, utilising various accounting data platforms and software to meet client ad-hoc requests and queries. </p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>•	I prepared compliance reports for an Australasian private equity firm with international clientele ($50m) seeking to expand their investments and investors.  I advised on domestic and international investments financial policies and regulation, producing process notes and procedures to manage compliance obligations  (i.e. tax, AML/CTF and LP disclosures). </li>
										</ul>
											<p></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Prepared consulting advice for the restructure of a multinational HNW client to streamline business processes, transaction handling cross-border and international compliance issues (HK/SG/AU/NZ). By analysing their financial transactional data, we were able to simulate what-if scenarios and eliminate unfavourable outcomes.</li>
										</ul>	
											<p></p>

								
									<h3 class="minor">Legal Accountant</h3>
										<h4 class="minor"><i>Nov 2013 - Dec 2016 (3 years)</i></h4>
										<p>Prpeared financial statements and tax returns for SME (<$2M NZD) as well as financial valuation of assets and application of legislation.</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>In a divorce proceeding, I prepared valuation figures and checks for a jointly owned investment company.  The initial valuation provided to our client by the opposing lawyers was severely undervalued by $200k.  Through mediation and following the proper legal channels, we were able to reach a rectified settlement between the parties.</li>
										</ul>
											<p></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Inland Revenue conducted an audit of a client's group of entities, with risk of a tax avoidance judgement. I led the client defence, in charge of preparing the necessary proof documentation and liasing with tax authorities appealing their case.  By using investigative data analysis tools, I presented our case to Inland revenue, successfully defending and confirming the accuracy of the client's position.</li>
